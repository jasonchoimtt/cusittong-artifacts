This course is taught by a series of lectures and small group tutorials. There are family visits and interviews.

Methods for infection prevention and control measures in the hospital are also introduced in the form of Basic Infection Control Module. N95 respirator qualitative fit-test will be conducted within the module."

Medicine 1 consists of 9-week attachment to the medical wards in Princess Margaret Hospital, North District Hospital, Shatin Hospital, Our Lady of Maryknoll Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital. Students will be attached to each of the above hospitals in rotation. Medicine 2 involves small group attachments to medical wards under the supervision of Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Department of Clinical Oncology, and Accident and Emergency Medicine Academic Unit in the Prince of Wales Hospital. Students will attach to each of the above Departments in rotation to learn from patients in the wards through daily clinical activities. Students are encouraged to clerk patients and present during subspecialty rounds, and to follow patient progress during their hospital stay.  Subspecialty teaching sessions will be held on every Wednesday throughout the two modules.  Students will attach to subspecialty activities and outpatient clinics at their respective rotations.  Bedside teaching on clinical skills will be arranged in small groups twice weekly.  All students at medical rotations will attend medical grand round every Wednesday.\rA one-week Resident Mentorship Programme (RMP) is integrated into Medicine 2.  Students will shadow resident mentors to learn and experience daily clinical work for both inpatients and outpatients.  Through active participation of clinical activities under close supervision by frontline doctors, the programme helps develop the students’ core competencies of medical professionalism.  The RMP aims to nurture self-initiatives, sense of responsibility, stress coping, communication skills and social responsibility through experiential learning in the real-life clinical setting.\rCommunications skills in clinical settings. There will be small group tutorials during both clerkships as well as during Resident Mentorship Programme period for developing communication skills in a clinical and professional setting. This includes presentations in medical rounds, writing patients' scripts and referrals, communications with lay public on medical matters, handling complaints and bad news, organizing and presenting literature or decision making in clinical conferences. These skills are also assessed formally at end-of-module examinations and are also an obligatory component of final year graduating examinations. Multidisciplinary integrative sessions will be maintained.",
