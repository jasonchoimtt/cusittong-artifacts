First part introduces organization of the extra-cranial structures; second part focuses on the organization of the central nervous system. The course is taught through lectures, supplemented with experiential learning in dissecting laboratory and other practical sessions. Different regions of the head and neck, including the bony components and associated organ systems will be examined. The detailed blood supply and cranial nerve innervation will be emphasized. This will be followed by the study of the organization of the brain and spinal cord, and their control of the structures of the head and neck. Lastly, the embryonic development of the head and central nervous system including sense organs like the eye and ear will be followed to allow students to appreciate how the overall complexity of this body region becomes established.",

The therapeutic relationship enables the health professional and the patient to engage and effect beneficial change in the patient. This therapeutic relationship may be a one-off encounter or can be lifelong.  The student should already have a deep understanding of the challenges from the doctor’s perspective and the range and variety of medical conditions of patient presentation.   \rThis course is a continuation of Doctor and Patient I and takes a deeper exploration of the patient’s perspective and person centred care and how this impacts the therapeutic consultation.  Meanwhile, the student continues to engage with the family and the child is reaching one year old.\r\rThe course has two components:\rPart A continues the clinical visits with a doctor.  During these visits, the attention is now drawn to the patient’s perspective in dissecting the \rbiopsychosocial components of the clinical presentation, the illness trajectory, and the communication and the interaction and exchange between the doctor and the patient. Meanwhile, issues relating to caring for those in decline and dying will be discussed. \rPart B is the continuation of the family follow up project and gives the students insight into the biological, social, psychological and medical context of care in the  child's first year of life.  . This course is taught by a series of lectures and small group tutorials. There are clinical visits to family doctors and family visits and interviews."

              "ENG": "This course provides 9 weeks of integrated teaching in Community and Family Medicine. \r\rIn Community Medicine, three major areas are covered: Epidemiology, Public Health Practice, and Occupation and Environmental Health. Students will be introduced to the principles and practice of public health, the application of epidemiological methods, and the prevention and control of communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases and occupational diseases.  In addition to didactic lectures, students will learn the subject areas through active participation in problem-solving exercises, field visits and presentations in seminars and tutorials.\r\rThe clinical clerkship in Family Medicine aims at teach practical family medicine skills and to equip students with the understanding and ability to diagnose and manage common medical conditions that present to primary care.   Throughout the clerkship, the students will be taught skills in diagnoses formation of undifferentiated symptoms, prioritisation of multiple medical conditions and first line investigations and management of common medical problems in the community.  Students will also gain exposure to the basic principles and practice of family medicine in providing primary, comprehensive, holistic approach and continuing person centred care.  The clinical clerkship will consist of online teaching, case based seminars and tutorial, clinical attachments to private family medicine providers as well as the public Hospital Authority clinics and community hospitals and health care providers for vulnerable populations. Teaching will also involve roleplay in skills workshops and facilitated clinical enhanced skills training.  Clinical teaching will involve University Family Medicine Clinics, and at Family Medicine clinics run by Hospital Authority and private practitioners, both in public and private settings across the whole territory.",

Medicine 1 consists of 9-week attachment to the medical wards in Princess Margaret Hospital, North District Hospital, Shatin Hospital, Our Lady of Maryknoll Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital. Students will be attached to each of the above hospitals in rotation. Medicine 2 involves small group attachments to medical wards under the supervision of Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Department of Clinical Oncology, and Accident and Emergency Medicine Academic Unit in the Prince of Wales Hospital. Students will attach to each of the above Departments in rotation to learn from patients in the wards through daily clinical activities. Students are encouraged to clerk patients and present during subspecialty rounds, and to follow patient progress during their hospital stay.  Subspecialty teaching sessions will be held on every Wednesday throughout the two modules.  Students will attach to subspecialty activities and outpatient clinics at their respective rotations.  Bedside teaching on clinical skills will be arranged in small groups twice weekly.  All students at medical rotations will attend medical grand round every Wednesday.\rA one-week Resident Mentorship Programme (RMP) is integrated into Medicine 2.  Students will shadow resident mentors to learn and experience daily clinical work for both inpatients and outpatients.  Through active participation of clinical activities under close supervision by frontline doctors, the programme helps develop the students’ core competencies of medical professionalism.  The RMP aims to nurture self-initiatives, sense of responsibility, stress coping, communication skills and social responsibility through experiential learning in the real-life clinical setting.\rCommunications skills in clinical settings. There will be small group tutorials during both clerkships as well as during Resident Mentorship Programme period for developing communication skills in a clinical and professional setting. This includes presentations in medical rounds, writing patients' scripts and referrals, communications with lay public on medical matters, handling complaints and bad news, organizing and presenting literature or decision making in clinical conferences. These skills are also assessed formally at end-of-module examinations and are also an obligatory component of final year graduating examinations. Multidisciplinary integrative sessions will be maintained.",

The attachments will include a total of 17 weeks at Prince of Wales Hospital and 3 weeks at Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital. Students will work alongside with qualified colleagues to gain direct hands-on clinical experience in the form of apprenticeship. They will also receive small group bedside teaching on each ward. In the afternoons subspecialty teaching will be given on three to four days per week and will cover all 13 major medical specialties. \r\rAdditional activities will include short courses in critical care medicine and in evidence-based medicine, and multidisciplinary sessions which will liaise both with Surgery and with basic sciences to cover important revision topics prior to the final examinations.",

Students will work alongside with qualified professionals to gain direct hands-on clinical experience in the form of apprenticeship. They will also receive small group bedside teaching on each ward. Clinical management of patients in various specialties and essential clinical skills for junior doctors are the main highlights in this programme.\r\rCommunications skills in clinical settings. There will be small group tutorials during  the clerkships as well as during the Assistant Internship period for developing communication skills in a clinical and professional setting. This includes presentations in medical rounds, writing patients' scripts and referrals, communications with lay public on medical matters, handling complaints and bad news, organizing and presenting literature or decision making in clinical conferences. These skills are also assessed formally at end-of-module examinations and are also an obligatory component of final year graduating examinations. Multidisciplinary integrative sessions will be maintained.",
