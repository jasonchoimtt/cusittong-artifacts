              "ENG": "While the production of data is expanding at an astonishing pace, companies are on average using only a fraction of the data out there. Recent survey by IMA (Institute of Management Accountants) in 2016 reveals significant skill gaps in many areas employers need most, especially identifying key data trends, data mining and extraction, operational analysis, technological acumen, statistical modeling and data analysis. This course targets towards accounting students who are interested in getting hands-on experience with data analytics and rising to the challenges and opportunities big data presents to the profession. The course will provide a basis for handling and analyzing large-scale data stored within and outside an organization and finding business insights from analyses. In the first two-thirds of the course, we will study the basic concepts and techniques related to data preprocessing, data exploration, model building and results interpretation. Instead of digging deep into technical details, the course will provide a broad survey of common approaches and focus on the pragmatic implementation of data analytics. In the latter one-third of the course, we will discuss the emerging trends in big data and their applications in the accounting profession as well as other industries. The course will try to utilize real datasets related to accounting and finance and enable students to “learn by doing” through hands-on experience with data.Prerequisites: Students who take the course need a basic background of statistics. Having a passion for learning new things is important for the course.Grade descriptors:A Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.A- Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.B Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes.F Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

Students need to find a faculty member willing to serve as the supervisor, and together, devise a format. There are a wide range of possibilities under independent study. The more common alternatives are: (a) Selection of a topic not normally covered in our curriculum in which the student has an interest. Normally the student would prepare a literature review on the selected topic. It would then be common for the student to perform some application or extension of this body of knowledge by extending or substantiating that knowledge by some data collection. (b) Preparation of a case and accompanying teacher’s note. The case must be based on real organizations and substantial data collection would be expected. The student would be expected to demonstrate application of theory in preparation of the teacher’s note.Grade descriptors:A Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.A- Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.B Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes.F Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

              "ENG": "In the increasingly competitive world, the need for timely analysis of constantly expanding data to gain business intelligence and communication of the results to the key decision makers has become a vital part of a company’s operation. In the past, business intelligence used to be in the domain of IT specialists. With the advent of self-service data visualization and business intelligence tools, such as Excel BI toolkit, now anyone with adequate training can produce their own analyses with minimal support from central IT. The aim of this course is to introduce to students the Excel BI toolkit that has become an integral part of Excel since Excel 2013. Designed to handle very large amount of data, the toolkit consists of four add-ins, namely, Power Query, Power Pivot, Power View, and Power Map. Students will learn how to use these add-ins to gain business intelligence. Students who are interested in taking this course are expected to have at least intermediate level and preferably advanced level of Excel skills.

              "ENG": "Practicum provides opportunities for students to develop their abilities and competence in integrating theory and practice under professional supervision. Each EP Trainee is expected to have fieldwork training of a minimum of 1200 hours, with at least 600 hours in educational settings, for the whole practicum. The first practicum provides hands-on experience in relation to individual work and group work.  It should include experiences in working with students, families and/ or teachers. The placement sites/ collaborating parties can include, but not limited to, the educational psychology service unit of the Faculty, and mentorship scheme under the MA(EP) program. In the second and third practicum, EP trainees are supervised closely and regularly by qualified educational/  clinical psychologists in the field. The placements provide hands-on experience in relation to individual work, group work, and systems work, encompassing a wide range of student/ school needs, and they should include experiences in working with students, families, teachers, and improving the school system. The practicum settings include, but not limited to, preschools, primary schools, secondary schools, tertiary institutions and government departments.Grade DescriptorsGrade     Overall PerformanceA            Excellent performance on ALL learning outcomes.

The principal focus is on initial public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned issues in Chinese stocks (including H- share, ‘red-chip’, private Chinese and ‘China-concept’ issuers) listed in Hong Kong. The characteristics of the various corporate entities and the nature of the funding methods utilized are critically explored. Case analysis of major IPO and seasoned equity issues (rights issues and private placings) features to amplify these objectives. Shanghai A- share listings are also considered as well as the various reforms to its constituent issuers. These include the transformation of non-tradable stock holdings into tradable form, the development of QFII and QDII schemes and the key reforms to China’s leading state-owned commercial banks. Finally, dual listings, such as American depositary receipts, and alternative routes to listing (‘reverse takeovers’) are also assessed. Upon completion of the course, students will have developed key insights into a major global funding activity.Grade descriptors:A / A- Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.B+ / B / B- Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C+ / C / C- Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D+ / D Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomesF Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

The course will consider the investment decision of institutional investors in private equity and how funds are structured to meet their needs. It will discuss post-subscription private equity fund management - deal screening, evaluation, negotiation, disbursement, investee management, valuation and exit - and will consider specifically the perspective of the VC investee company - alternative sources of financing, how to approach a VC to maximize chances of success, and governance issues in VC financed firms. The course may also delve into public versus private equity buyouts, valuation of buyouts and corporate restructuring under private equity.Blended-mode class section is available for this course.

              "ENG": "Traditional finance seeks to understand financial markets assuming that investors are \"rational\". Rationality means that investors can access to and have the ability to process information correctly and that competition between investors ensures that securities are correctly priced to reflect all available information. That is, the market is efficient. However, recent studies suggest that markets are not efficient and that investors are not fully rational. For example, particular trading strategies based on past information such as past returns and accounting information are able to outperform the markets. In addition, studies find that investors are committed to certain heuristic-based biases and frame dependent such as overconfidence, optimism, self-attribution, illusion of control, loss aversion, representativeness heuristic, anchoring, availability, ambiguity aversion, hindsight, flaming, etc. Behavioral biases combined with limits to arbitrage may result in securities not to be correctly priced.This course will help students understand how individuals’ attitudes and behaviors affect their financial decisions and financial markets. In the practical side, this course will emphasize the role of investors’ psychological biases on various types of market inefficiency and show that how sophisticated investors can take advantage of these behavioral biases. This is a research oriented course with emphasis on both psychology theories and data analysis skills.Grade descriptors:A / A- Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.B+ / B / B- Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C+ / C / C- Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D+ / D Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomesF Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

Topics include the role of derivative securities, the determination of forward and futures prices, hedging strategies using futures, trading strategies with futures, properties of options, the pricing of stock options, options on indices, currencies and futures contracts, risk analysis, applications of option pricing models, biases in the Black-Scholes model, interest rate options, exotic options, risk management with options, and trading strategies with options. The course demonstrates the ways in which financial innovations profoundly affect the alternatives available to corporations, investment managers, and financial intermediaries. While some technical aspects of financial engineering are going to be covered, many cases are chosen to bridge the gaps between theories and practices. Students are encouraged to use Excel, VBA or other computational tools to build and analyze models.Grade descriptors:A / A- : Outstanding performance on all learning outcomesB+ / B / B- : Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C+ / C / C- : Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D+ / D : Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes.F : Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

Unlike other real estate assets focusing only on the rental income paid by the tenants, the shopping mall predominantly concerns about the business of the tenants and how to increase their revenue. The shopping mall business thus requires thorough management to attract more customers and to increase the traffic flow. Despite the significance of site selection and financial feasibility, other important factors determining the success of a shopping mall include tenant mix, marketing and promotion, operation and maintenance, as well as asset enhancement. This course introduces theoretical knowledge and concept affecting the development and management of the shopping mall.

              "ENG": "This course provides an opportunity for the MBA students to apply what they have learned in the classroom to solving real-world business problems. A minimum of three and a maximum of five students are required to form a project team, under the supervision of a BA faculty member. A project proposal outlining the work to be undertaken by the project team must be approved by the supervising faculty member and endorsed by the Director of MBA Programmes or his/her representative within 10 calendar days from the start of the term. The project must be sponsored by a company in Hong Kong and approved by the Director. The sponsorship includes joint supervision of the project by an appointed senior staff of the company, pledge of assistance and support to ensure the successful completion of the project, and possible remuneration to members of the project team, other than the supervising faculty member, for the work undertaken. Students are expected to spend, on the average, one day a week throughout the duration of the project. The project duration must cover the term time as published by the University calendar, but should not exceed four months in duration. A final report of the project to be submitted to the supervising faculty member and an oral presentation of the results to the management of the sponsor is part of the requirements of the course. The final grades of the students will be determined by the supervising faculty member, in which the evaluation of the project by the sponsoring body should be reflected.  MBA (Evening Mode) and MBA (Weekend Mode) students are eligible to register the course subject to the Director's approval.Grade descriptors:A Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.A- Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.B Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes.F Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

              "ENG": "The course develops a valuable set of core consulting skills and provides a rich appreciation of modern management consulting of value to both prospective management consultants and to other business students who expect to engage and work with management consultants during their future career.  The course complements the Business Practicum elective in which students have the opportunity to apply consulting skills in a real consulting engagement with a local company.  In a typical session, the first hour will be an overview lecture on the Topic, or a discussion of the assigned Readings.  A short 'Industry interlude' will cover aspects of the history and structure of the management consulting industry, including ethics, professional qualifications and recruitment practices.  The final ninety minutes will be spent on an assigned \"caselet\" (a short-form case) based on a real management consulting engagement.  Caselets will cover commercial organizations in China and overseas, as well as consulting interventions in not-for-profits and the Public Sector. Students will be placed into groups and each group will be asked to practice specific consulting skills and roles, with opportunities for each student to plan a consulting engagement, facilitate discussions with clients, and lead a consulting team.Blended-mode class section is available for this course.  Please refer to the “Class Notes” of the blended-mode class section for details.Grade descriptors:A Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.A- Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.B Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes.F Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

As industries become increasingly competitive, it is clear that strong brand-building skills are needed to survive and prosper. The Strategic Brand Management course is designed to provide conceptual background as well as practical approaches (i.e., relevant research techniques) to manage brands as a strategic asset as well as a primary source of competitive advantage. Topics include new product development process, brand creation, brand building, measuring/monitoring brand equity, and revitalizing brands. Although brands are one of the most important assets for any business, it is found that managers generally do not have very clear idea how to successfully manage their brands. Far too few managers really understand the concept of brand equity and how it must be implemented. In other words, managers need to learn the basic brand building concepts as well as the research techniques that can be used to collect data for brand planning. The objective of this course is to provide students with understanding regarding brand building concepts as well as to equip students with research techniques that can be used to build and manage a successful brand.Grade descriptors:A Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.A- Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.B Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes.F Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

              "ENG": "Making decisions, from the trivial to the fundamental, is part of the everyday life of every manager and investor. For the last 30 years, psychologists — and more recently also economists — have studied how people process information and make decisions. This research program has provided an insightful understanding of how people’s decisions deviate from “optimal” ones, and the consequences of such biases in financial and personal terms. This course is devoted to understanding the nature, causes and managerial implications of these limitations. It will help the students discover a series of serious yet often overlooked mistakes that most people would commit in a variety of decision contexts, including investment decisions, hiring decisions, purchase decisions and even marital decisions. At the same time, this course will also teach them how to correct these mistakes and how to reach optimal solutions. Instead of overwhelming the students with mathematic models or academic theories, this course will use many in-class exercises and questionnaires to convey the concepts.Blended-mode class section is available for this course.  Please refer to the “Class Notes” of the blended-mode class section for details.Grade descriptors:A Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.A- Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.B Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomesF Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

              "ENG": "These blocks aim to provide students with clinical practice opportunities in order to apply principles, concepts, and theories for the care of clients with various specialty conditions. These conditions include medical, geriatrics, paediatrics, and emergency. In addition, this will allow students to have clinical practice opportunities in caring for pediatric and geriatric clients. The students will be given the chance to practice in both community and hospital settings. They will be assisted in the development of clinical problemsolving skills and on the use of a nursing care plan in clinical settings. This will greatly support students in their transition to become Registered Nurses. Hence, a three-month continuous clinical practice period will be arranged within these clinical practice blocks. Furthermore, students are facilitated to be integrated into the health care team in clinical practice.Grade DescriptorsA: An outstanding level of attainment of all the course learning outcomes. Consistent evidence of in-depth and critical understanding, synthesis and creativity in the application of the knowledge, skills, concepts and principles learnt in the course. Outstanding level of accuracy in knowledge and skill application.B: Attainment of most of the course learning outcomes. Evidence of critical understanding, integration and certain level of creativity in the application of the knowledge, skills, concepts and principles learnt in the course. Good level of accuracy in knowledge and skill application. C: Attainment of at least 50% of the course learning outcomes. Evidence of understanding of the fundamental knowledge, skills, concepts and principles learnt in the course. Fair level of accuracy in knowledge and skill application. D: Limited attainment of the course learning outcomes. Insufficient evidence of understanding fundamental knowledge, skills, concepts and principles learnt in the course. Low level of accuracy in knowledge and skill application.F: An insufficient level of attainment of the course learning outcomes, or failure to meet the specific assessment requirements.Note: ‘D’ and ‘F’ are failure grades for Master of Nursing Science (Pre-registration) Programme"
