The rules of Conflict of Laws (sometimes known as Private International Law) are orientated to answering three questions: (i) Which law applies in the event of a conflict? (ii) Do Hong Kong courts have jurisdiction to determine the dispute and should they exercise jurisdiction? (iii) Should a Hong Kong court recognise and enforce a foreign court’s judgment? These questions are examined in a few selected areas of law such as contracts, torts, family law, criminal law, and property.",

Globalization inevitably implies that merger operations can bear effects on the conditions of competition in multiple jurisdictions, and therefore companies will have to ensure that their operations comply with the laws of every jurisdiction that comes into play. The large transactions are often subject to scrutiny by several regimes simultaneously. As a consequence, companies need to be aware of the implications of the principal merger control regimes to avoid delays and uncertainty.

The course will analyse local merger control rules as well as the rules of those regimes which most frequently apply to merger transactions involving local firms.

For the last 30 years psychologists — and more recently also economists — have studied how people process information and make decisions. This research program has provided an insightful understanding of how people’s decisions deviate from “optimal” ones, and the consequences of such biases in financial and personal terms. This course is devoted to understanding the nature, causes and managerial implications of these limitations. It will help the students discover a series of serious yet often overlooked mistakes that most people would commit in a variety of decision contexts, including investment decisions, hiring decisions, purchase decisions and even marital decisions. At the same time, this course will also teach them how to correct these mistakes and how to reach optimal solutions.  Instead of overwhelming the students with mathematic models or academic theories, this course will use many in-class exercises and questionnaires to convey the concepts.",

You will learn about the key concepts of mental disorders, how mental  predispositions and upbringing experience interact in the development of various mental disorders, how human mind works in different mental disorders, and more importantly, how you can continue to learn about the science of psychopathology on your own after you have completed the course.
