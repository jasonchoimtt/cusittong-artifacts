The issues are highlighted through lectures or seminars by university professors, and visits to world class companies or research and development centres.  Students will have chance to discuss with top executives from these companies.  Through this course, students will be able to understand the strategies companies adopted, and solutions in tackling business issues.\r\rGrade descriptors:\rA Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.\rA- Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.\rB Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.\rC Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.\rD Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes.\rF Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements.",

The practice of law in Hong Kong is marked not only by the common law tradition but also by socialist law and the civil law tradition. There are even traces left of the pre-colonial indigenous Chinese legal practices in Hong Kong. Globalization has increased the volume of cross-border activities beyond Hong Kong and mainland China, requiring lawyers to become familiar with multi-jurisdictional issues. Consequently, comparative legal work is gaining in importance both globally and in Hong Kong. \r\rThis course is designed to prepare students to practice law in an international setting and to give credit to the growing practical significance of comparative legal work. Students will examine the meaning and instrumental benefits of comparative law, explore how various legal systems and traditions are adapting to change, learn about academic debates within comparative law, and critically analyse traditional concepts of comparative law. They will also learn to appreciate the insights of approaching legal systems through a comparative perspective. This course has an emphasis on Asian legal systems and the law of the People’s Republic of China, in particular.\r\rFor details of grade descriptors, please refer to http://www.law.cuhk.edu.hk/download/CUHK_Faculty_of_Law_Grade_Descriptors.pdf.",

By incorporating a more extended range of mandatory readings than undergraduate courses of similar length and a more research-focused assessment regime, this course is designed specifically for students at the postgraduate level who, apart from LAWS6021, have not previously studied the law of contracts as it applies in a common law jurisdiction. Throughout the course students will be expected to continue evaluating and discussing the part played by contracts in facilitating economic and social co-ordination in a free community with particular reference to Hong Kong’s context at a level appropriate for postgraduate studies. Students will: extend and deepen their understanding of several areas of contract law to which they were introduced in LAWS6021 while being further introduced to the common law’s methods, techniques, and core values; and develop their problem-solving, research, writing, and advocacy skills to a level appropriate for postgraduate study. This course involves a more extensive and in-depth exploration of the following topics: remedies for breach of contract (damages, penalty clauses, specific performance, injunction, exemption and limitation clauses); factors defeating contractual liability (illegality, public policy, misrepresentation, mistake, non est factum, duress, undue influence, and unconscionability).\r\rFor details of grade descriptors, please refer to http://www.law.cuhk.edu.hk/download/CUHK_Faculty_of_Law_Grade_Descriptors.pdf.",

              "ENG": "Making decisions, from the trivial to the fundamental, is part of the everyday life of every manager and investor. For the last 30 years, psychologists — and more recently also economists — have studied how people process information and make decisions. This research program has provided an insightful understanding of how people’s decisions deviate from “optimal” ones, and the consequences of such biases in financial and personal terms. This course is devoted to understanding the nature, causes and managerial implications of these limitations. It will help the students discover a series of serious yet often overlooked mistakes that most people would commit in a variety of decision contexts, including investment decisions, hiring decisions, purchase decisions and even marital decisions. At the same time, this course will also teach them how to correct these mistakes and how to reach optimal solutions. Instead of overwhelming the students with mathematic models or academic theories, this course will use many in-class exercises and questionnaires to convey the concepts.\r\rGrade descriptors:\rA Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.\rA- Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.\rB Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial\rperformance.\rC Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.\rD Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes\rF Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements.",
