The issues are highlighted through lectures or seminars by university professors, and visits to world class companies or research and development centres.  Students will have chance to discuss with top executives from these companies.  Through this course, students will be able to understand the strategies companies adopted, and solutions in tackling business issues.\r\rGrade descriptors:\rA Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.\rA- Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.\rB Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.\rC Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.\rD Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes.\rF Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements.",

              "ENG": "Making decisions, from the trivial to the fundamental, is part of the everyday life of every manager and investor. For the last 30 years, psychologists — and more recently also economists — have studied how people process information and make decisions. This research program has provided an insightful understanding of how people’s decisions deviate from “optimal” ones, and the consequences of such biases in financial and personal terms. This course is devoted to understanding the nature, causes and managerial implications of these limitations. It will help the students discover a series of serious yet often overlooked mistakes that most people would commit in a variety of decision contexts, including investment decisions, hiring decisions, purchase decisions and even marital decisions. At the same time, this course will also teach them how to correct these mistakes and how to reach optimal solutions. Instead of overwhelming the students with mathematic models or academic theories, this course will use many in-class exercises and questionnaires to convey the concepts.\r\rGrade descriptors:\rA Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.\rA- Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.\rB Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial\rperformance.\rC Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.\rD Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes\rF Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements.",
