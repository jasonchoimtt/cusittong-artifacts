Students are introduced to the principles and practice of public health, the application of epidemiological methods, and the prevention and control of communicable, non-communicable and occupational diseases. In addition to didactic lectures, students are required to actively participate in problem-solving exercises, field visits and presentations in seminars and tutorials. \r\rThe clinical clerkship in Family Medicine teaches practical family medicine skills and equips students with the understanding and ability to diagnose and manage common medical conditions that present in primary care settings. Throughout the clerkship, students are taught skills in making differential diagnoses of presenting symptoms, prioritisation of multiple medical conditions and first line investigations and management of common medical problems in the community. Students also gain exposure to the basic principles and practice of family medicine, i.e., providing primary, comprehensive, holistic and continuing person centred care. The clinical clerkship consists of online teaching, case based seminars and tutorials, clinical attachments to private family medicine providers, Hospital Authority clinics and community hospitals and health care providers for vulnerable populations. To facilitate learning, role playing in workshops and clinical enhanced skills training are provided. Facilities utilised for this clinical teaching include the University Family Medicine Clinics, and Family Medicine clinics run by Hospital Authority and private practitioners, both in public and private settings across throughout Hong Kong. \r\rGrade Descriptor:\rGrade   -  Overall Course\rA   -\tOutstanding performance on all learning outcomes.\rA-  -\tGenerally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.\rB   - \tSubstantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.\rC   -\tSatisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.\rD   -\tBarely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes\rF    -\tUnsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements.",

              "ENG": "The Senior Medical Clerkship consists of two nine-week modules, referred to as Medicine 1 and Medicine 2. Medicine 1 consists of a nine-week attachment to the medical wards in Princess Margaret Hospital, North District Hospital, Shatin Hospital, Our Lady of Maryknoll Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital. Students are attached to each of the above hospitals in rotation. Medicine 2 involves small group attachments to medical wards under the supervision of Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Department of Clinical Oncology, and Accident and Emergency Medicine Academic Unit in the Prince of Wales Hospital. Students are attached to each of the above Departments in rotation in order to learn by daily clinical contact with patients on the respective wards. Students are encouraged to clerk patients and present during subspecialty rounds, and to follow patients’ progress during their hospital stay. Subspecialty teaching sessions are also held every Wednesday throughout the two modules. Students are attached to subspecialty activities and outpatient clinics during their respective rotations. Bedside teaching of clinical skills is arranged in small groups twice weekly. All students in these medical rotations are expected to attend medical grand rounds every Wednesday.\rA one-week Resident Mentorship Programme (RMP) is integrated into Medicine 2. Students shadow resident mentors, learning and experiencing daily clinical work with both inpatients and outpatients. Requiring active participation in clinical activities under close supervision by frontline doctors, the programme is designed to help students develop core competencies as medical professionals. The RMP aims to nurture self-initiative, sense of responsibility, stress coping strategies, communication skills and social responsibility through experiential learning in actual clinical settings.\rSmall group tutorials during both clerkships as well as during Resident Mentorship Programme are provided in order to further develop students’ communication skills within clinical and professional settings. This includes presenting in medical rounds, writing patients' scripts and referrals, having communications with lay public concerning medical matters, handling complaints and bad news, organizing and presenting literature or decision making in clinical conferences. These skills are assessed formally in the end-of-module examinations and are also an obligatory component of final year graduating examinations. Multidisciplinary integrative sessions are maintained throughout this course.\r\rGrade Descriptor:\rGrade   -  Overall Course\rA   -\tOutstanding performance on all learning outcomes.\rA-  -\tGenerally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.\rB   - \tSubstantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.\rC   -\tSatisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.\rD   -\tBarely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes\rF    -\tUnsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements.",

The attachments will include a total of 17 weeks at Prince of Wales Hospital and 3 weeks at Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital. Students will work alongside with qualified colleagues to gain direct hands-on clinical experience in the form of apprenticeship. They will also receive small group bedside teaching on each ward. In the afternoons subspecialty teaching will be given on three to four days per week and will cover all 13 major medical specialties. \r\rAdditional activities will include short courses in critical care medicine and in evidence-based medicine, and multidisciplinary sessions which will liaise both with Surgery and with basic sciences to cover important revision topics prior to the final examinations.",
