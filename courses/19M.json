By way of an interdisciplinary teaching team, cases and questions are presented to students in conjunction with insights drawn from history, philosophy, health policy, medicine and beyond. The curriculum introduces core ethical principles including autonomy, beneficence and justice and the utilitarian and deontological concerns related to these principles. The course addresses three key areas of bioethics—clinical ethics, public health ethics and research ethics and the specific ethical constructs in each field. The first unit serves to acquaint students with the features of the online learning platform.Grade Descriptor:Pass -  Satisfactory performance on all learning outcomes.Fail  - Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

              "ENG": "Medical schools strive to educate knowledgeable, caring and professional physicians. The growing interest in empathy, wellness and resilience has fuelled the design and implementation of structured educational programmes worldwide to cultivate empathy especially at a time of increasing professional burnout among undergraduates and resident trainees.Empathy in the medical setting includes the appreciation of the patient’s emotions and the expression of that awareness. Empathy is an essential learning objective and it is believed to significantly influence patient satisfaction, adherence to medical recommendations, clinical outcomes, and professional satisfaction.A key component to empathy is reflective capacity. Fostering reflective capacity within medical education helps develop critical thinking skills inform clinical reasoning, and enhance professionalism among trainees. Development of reflective capacity has been highlighted as necessary for effective use of feedback in medical education and is an essential aspect of self-regulated and lifelong learning. Failure to reflect on one’s own thinking processes, including critical examination of one’s assumptions, beliefs, and conclusions, was recently described as a cognitive component of “physician overconfidence,” a contributing cause of diagnostic error in medicine.Reflection is not necessarily intuitive, especially in students at initial stages of their medical careers.The over-arching aim of the course is to nurture and consolidate the key soft skills of an effective doctor, as well as healthy resilient personality through the development of reflective capacity and empathy.The course is delivered in progressive stages to build reflective capacity and empathy in specific professional developmental contexts. The four building blocks as outlined below will be emphasized in different years. The building blocks will be progressively built and integrated over curriculum from year 2 to year 4.1. Empathic Engagement (Year 2)2. Doctor and Society (Year 3)3. Doctor and Self- Reflection in Practice (Year 4)4. Doctor and Profession (Year 4)The four components encompass the core values of a healthy and competent doctor who is able to foster therapeutic alliance with patients, appreciate and reflect the meaning of work, being a team player as well as connection with public and society.Grade Descriptor:Pass -  Satisfactory performance on all learning outcomes.Fail  - Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

The therapeutic relationship enables the health professional and the patient to become cooperatively engaged and thereby effect beneficial change in the patient. This therapeutic relationship may be a one-off encounter or can be lifelong.  The student should already have a deep understanding of the challenges from the doctor’s perspective and the range and variety of medical conditions of patient presentation.   This course is a continuation of Doctor and Patient I and II and complements the experiences gleaned from the visits that are made in the family project during the child’s second and third year of life. The course aims to give students insights into the biological, social, psychological and medical context of care in the child's second and third year of life.  This course is taught by a series of lectures and small group tutorials. There are family visits and interviews. The course ends after community and family medicine, paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology and psychiatry rotations so that the student has a comprehensive overview of the medical, developmental and social aspects to the family and child and the role of the community in health care. Case presentations in the interdisciplinary seminar discuss salient learning points in the course.Grade Descriptor:Pass :Satisfactory performance on all learning outcomes.Fail :Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

First part introduces organization of the extra-cranial structures; second part focuses on the organization of the central nervous system. The course is taught through lectures, supplemented with experiential learning in dissecting laboratory and other practical sessions. Different regions of the head and neck, including the bony components and associated organ systems are examined. The detailed blood supply and cranial nerve innervation is emphasized. This is followed by the study of the organization of the brain and spinal cord, and their control of the structures of the head and neck. Lastly, the embryonic development of the head and central nervous system including sense organs like the eye and ear is followed to allow students to appreciate how the overall complexity of this body region becomes established.Grade Descriptor:Grade   -  Overall CourseA   -\tOutstanding performance on all learning outcomes.A-  -\tGenerally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.B   - \tSubstantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C   -\tSatisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D   -\tBarely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomesF    -\tUnsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

              "ENG": "The doctor and patient relationship is essential to medical care and is a dynamic relationship.  A therapeutic relationship enables the health professional and patients to engage and effect beneficial change in patients. This therapeutic relationship may be one encounter or lifelong.  Students should already have a deep understanding of the challenges from the doctor’s perspective and the range and variety of medical conditions of patient presentation.   This course is a continuation of Doctor and Patient I and takes a deeper exploration of patient’s perspective and narrative and how this impacts the patient doctor interaction and communication strategies. The student also continues to engage with the family as the child is reaching one-year–old and interact and observe family dynamic, child development, health beliefs and social, medical and community support.The course has two components:Part I: Doctor-patient relationship in the communityThis is a continuation of the clinical visits with a doctor.  During these visits, the attention is now drawn to patient’s perspective and narrative in looking and listening closely to the words, tones, gestures and actions used in the patient’s experience of  illness, and the communication and the interaction and exchange between doctors and patients. Meanwhile, issues relating to the illness trajectory, decline and dying trajectories are discussed. Part II: Child and family development in the communityThis is the continuation of the family follow up project in which the students observe, interact and gain insight into the biological, social, psychological and medical context of care in the child's first year of life. This course is taught by a series of lectures and small group tutorials. There are clinical visits to family doctors and visits and interviews with a family.Grade Descriptor:Grade   -  Overall CourseA   -\tOutstanding performance on all learning outcomes.A-  -\tGenerally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.B   - \tSubstantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C   -\tSatisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D   -\tBarely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomesF    -\tUnsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

Areas considered include the doctor-patient relationship, patient capacity, consent, confidentiality, medical error and negligence, forensic pathology and related medical-legal issues, blood transfusion, end of life care and issues on the beginning of life.   Attention is also devoted to presenting a general framework of the legal system, in understanding the difference between civil law and criminal law, branches of the law, the hierarchy of laws, the court system and the law making process.  About 6-10 % of the course content will cover this, as we recognise that medical students should know their important role in society as physicians and as law-abiding citizens, in upholding justice and being a role model for others, in protecting the weak and vulnerable and in the prevention of crime, .e.g. in identifying victims of domestic violence, child or elder abuse.    Students will study and consider the distinctions and possible conflicts among law and regulation, professional standards, and generally recognized normative ethical obligations.Grade Descriptor:Pass :Satisfactory performance on all learning outcomes.Fail :Persistent failure to attend class sessions and/or unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

              "ENG": "This course provides 9 weeks of integrated teaching in Community and Family Medicine. In Community Medicine, three major areas are covered: Epidemiology, Public Health Practice, and Occupation and Environmental Health. Students are introduced to the principles and practice of public health, the application of epidemiological methods, and the prevention and control of communicable, non-communicable and occupational diseases. In addition to didactic lectures, students are required to actively participate in problem-solving exercises, field visits and presentations in seminars and tutorials. The clinical clerkship in Family Medicine teaches practical family medicine skills and equips students with the understanding and ability to diagnose and manage common medical conditions that present in primary care settings. Throughout the clerkship, students are taught skills in making differential diagnoses of presenting symptoms, prioritisation of multiple medical conditions and first line investigations and management of common medical problems in the community. Students also gain exposure to the basic principles and practice of family medicine, i.e., providing primary, comprehensive, holistic and continuing person centred care. The clinical clerkship consists of online teaching, case based seminars and tutorials, clinical attachments to private family medicine providers, Hospital Authority clinics and community hospitals and health care providers for vulnerable populations. To facilitate learning, role playing in workshops and clinical enhanced skills training are provided. Facilities utilised for this clinical teaching include the University Family Medicine Clinics, and Family Medicine clinics run by Hospital Authority and private practitioners, both in public and private settings across throughout Hong Kong.

During the antenatal attachment, students gain understanding of normal pregnancy, the development and growth of the unborn child, and acquire skill in performing obstetrics examinations. In the labour ward attachment, students participate in the care and delivery of normal pregnancies, as well as observe operative deliveries. They learn common problems and emergencies in childbirth and the postpartum period. In the gynaecology rotation, students learn common gynaecological conditions and neoplasm of the female reproductive tract. They also acquire skill in gynaecological examination. Communication skills in taking history and conducting discussions on issues regarding sexuality and reproduction are emphasized. Students also have the opportunity to attach to the O&G unit in one of the following affiliated hospitals: Princess Margaret Hospital, Tuen Mun Hospital, United Christian Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

The teaching of medical professionalism builds on introductory lectures provided in prior years and informal \"role modeling\" that occurs during the clinical curriculum. The module is designed to expand the students' cognitive base for professionalism, and to provide opportunities for internalizing related values and behaviours by collaborating in small group problem solving sessions. The workshops require analysis and development of moral solutions for simulated ethical dilemmas.

              "ENG": "The Senior Medical Clerkship consists of two nine-week modules, referred to as Medicine A and Medicine B. Medicine A consists of a nine-week attachment to the medical wards in Princess Margaret Hospital, North District Hospital, Shatin Hospital, Our Lady of Maryknoll Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital. Students are attached to each of the above hospitals in rotation. Medicine B involves small group attachments to medical wards under the supervision of Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Department of Clinical Oncology, and Accident and Emergency Medicine Academic Unit in the Prince of Wales Hospital. Students are attached to each of the above Departments in rotation in order to learn by daily clinical contact with patients on the respective wards. Students are encouraged to clerk patients and present during subspecialty rounds, and to follow patients’ progress during their hospital stay. Subspecialty teaching sessions are also held every Wednesday throughout the two modules. Students are attached to subspecialty activities and outpatient clinics during their respective rotations. Bedside teaching of clinical skills is arranged in small groups twice weekly. All students in these medical rotations are expected to attend medical grand rounds every Wednesday.A one-week Resident Mentorship Programme (RMP) is integrated into Medicine A. Students shadow resident mentors, learning and experiencing daily clinical work with both inpatients and outpatients. Requiring active participation in clinical activities under close supervision by frontline doctors, the programme is designed to help students develop core competencies as medical professionals. The RMP aims to nurture self-initiative, sense of responsibility, stress coping strategies, communication skills and social responsibility through experiential learning in actual clinical settings.Small group tutorials during both clerkships as well as during Resident Mentorship Programme are provided in order to further develop students’ communication skills within clinical and professional settings. This includes presenting in medical rounds, writing patients' scripts and referrals, having communications with lay public concerning medical matters, handling complaints and bad news, organizing and presenting literature or decision making in clinical conferences. These skills are assessed formally in the end-of-module examinations and are also an obligatory component of final year graduating examinations. Multidisciplinary integrative sessions are maintained throughout this course.Grade Descriptor:Grade   -  Overall CourseA :Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.A- :Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.B :Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C :Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D :Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomesF :Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

              "ENG": "The Senior Surgical Dressership consists of two nine-week modules involving small group attachments under the supervision of the Department of Surgery, Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Department of Imaging and Interventional Radiology and Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery.The attachments include professional rounds, outpatient clinics and the operating rooms in the Prince of Wales Hospital, North District Hospital, Yan Chai Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and Hong Kong Eye Hospital. Students work with qualified professionals in order to gain hands-on clinical experience (as in an apprenticeship). Students receive small group bedside teaching on each ward. Clinical management of patients in various specialties and essential clinical skills for junior doctors are the main foci in this training.Small group tutorials are held during both the Dressership as well as during the Assistant Internship period for purposes of developing communication skills in clinical and professional settings. This includes students presenting in medical rounds, writing patients' scripts and referrals, communicating with lay public concerning medical matters, handling complaints and bad news, organizing and presenting literature or decision making in clinical conferences. These skills are assessed formally at end-of-module examinations and are also an obligatory component in final year graduating examinations. Assessments include a written exam, an OSCE and a Clinical Examination that includes history taking, physical examination, interpretation of physical signs and investigations as well as management of patients with common surgical conditions.Grade Descriptor:Grade   -  Overall CourseA :Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.A- :Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.B :Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C :Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D :Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomesF :Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."
