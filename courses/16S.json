The more common alternatives are: (a) Selection of a topic not normally covered in our curriculum in which the student has an interest. Normally the student would prepare a literature review on the selected topic. It would then be common for the student to perform some application or extension of this body of knowledge by extending or substantiating that knowledge by some data collection. (b) Preparation of a case and accompanying teacher’s note. The case must be based on real organizations and substantial date collection would be expected.

The course is concluded with a written report and an oral presentation. The goal in taking classroom sessions abroad is to expose our graduate students to a wide spectrum of issues related to IT business, which includes research and development, company culture, and ways to manage a technology company. The issues are highlighted through lectures or seminars by university professors, and visits to world class companies or Research and development Centres.  Students will have chance to discuss with top executives from these companies.  Through this course, students will be able to understand the strategies companies adopted, and solutions in tackling business issues.",

It is the legal framework within which international life at the official level is conducted, and aims to facilitate an orderly, just and peaceful system of international relations.

              "ENG": "Mergers are the largest commercial transactions, and merger control is a fundamental part of competition law which regularly affects businesses in Hong Kong.  Mergers between companies are frequent in the business world, and more than 100 countries around the world have merger control laws that must be observed. Globalization inevitably implies that merger operations can bear effects on the conditions of competition in multiple jurisdictions, and therefore companies will have to ensure that their operations comply with the laws of every jurisdiction that comes into play. The large transactions are often subject to scrutiny by several regimes simultaneously. As a consequence, companies need to be aware of the implications of the principal merger control regimes to avoid delays and uncertainty. Firms in Hong Kong whose operations might affect other markets regularly seek legal advice on merger control rules in jurisdictions such as the US, the EU and Mainland China.\r\rThis course aims to provide students with a solid theoretical and practical understanding of the principal merger control regimes that affect companies in Hong Kong. On December 14, 2015, Hong Kong’s very own merger regime entered into force. For the time being, it only affects the telecommunications sector. The course will analyse local merger control rules as well as the rules of those regimes which most frequently apply to merger transactions involving local firms. Both procedural and substantive aspects are covered, and the principal focus of the course will be on substance.",

Mergers between companies are frequent in the business world, and more than 100 countries around the world have merger control laws that must be observed. Globalization inevitably implies that merger operations can bear effects on the conditions of competition in multiple jurisdictions, and therefore companies will have to ensure that their operations comply with the laws of every jurisdiction that comes into play. The large transactions are often subject to scrutiny by several regimes simultaneously. As a consequence, companies need to be aware of the implications of the principal merger control regimes to avoid delays and uncertainty. Firms in Hong Kong whose operations might affect other markets regularly seek legal advice on merger control rules in jurisdictions such as the US, the EU and Mainland China.\r\rThis course aims to provide students with a solid theoretical and practical understanding of the principal merger control regimes that affect companies in Hong Kong. On December 14, 2015, Hong Kong’s very own merger regime entered into force. For the time being, it only affects the telecommunications sector. The course will analyse local merger control rules as well as the rules of those regimes which most frequently apply to merger transactions involving local firms. Both procedural and substantive aspects are covered, and the principal focus of the course will be on substance.",

For the last 30 years psychologists — and more recently also economists — have studied how people process information and make decisions. This research program has provided an insightful understanding of how people’s decisions deviate from “optimal” ones, and the consequences of such biases in financial and personal terms. This course is devoted to understanding the nature, causes and managerial implications of these limitations. It will help the students discover a series of serious yet often overlooked mistakes that most people would commit in a variety of decision contexts, including investment decisions, hiring decisions, purchase decisions and even marital decisions. At the same time, this course will also teach them how to correct these mistakes and how to reach optimal solutions.  Instead of overwhelming the students with mathematic models or academic theories, this course will use many in-class exercises and questionnaires to convey the concepts.",
