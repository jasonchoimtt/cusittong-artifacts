              "ENG": "While the production of data is expanding at an astonishing pace, companies are on average using only a fraction of the data out there. Recent survey by IMA (Institute of Management Accountants) in 2016 reveals significant skill gaps in many areas employers need most, especially identifying key data trends, data mining and extraction, operational analysis, technological acumen, statistical modeling and data analysis. This course targets towards accounting students who are interested in getting hands-on experience with data analytics and rising to the challenges and opportunities big data presents to the profession. The course will provide a basis for handling and analyzing large-scale data stored within and outside an organization and finding business insights from analyses. In the first two-thirds of the course, we will study the basic concepts and techniques related to data preprocessing, data exploration, model building and results interpretation. Instead of digging deep into technical details, the course will provide a broad survey of common approaches and focus on the pragmatic implementation of data analytics. In the latter one-third of the course, we will discuss the emerging trends in big data and their applications in the accounting profession as well as other industries. The course will try to utilize real datasets related to accounting and finance and enable students to “learn by doing” through hands-on experience with data.Prerequisites: Students who take the course need a basic background of statistics. Having a passion for learning new things is important for the course.Grade descriptors:A Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.A- Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.B Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes.F Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

The course is concluded with a written report and an oral presentation. The goal in taking classroom sessions abroad is to expose our graduate students to a wide spectrum of issues related to IT business, which includes research and development, company culture, and ways to manage a technology company. The issues are highlighted through lectures or seminars by university professors, and visits to world class companies or research and development centres.  Students will have chance to discuss with top executives from these companies.  Through this course, students will be able to understand the strategies companies adopted, and solutions in tackling business issues.Grade descriptors:A Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.A- Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.B Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes.F Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

              "ENG": "The objective of the course is to allow students to acquire a basic understanding and the skills of the practical aspects of the financial technology profession.  To qualify for the award of the subject credits, the student must (a) attend regulatory workshop provided by such regulatory authorities as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Securities & Futures Commission, and Insurance Authority, and (b) attach to a company in a financial technology related post as approved by the Professor-in-Charge for no less than 12 weeks.  The student will have an academic supervisor as assigned by the Professor-in-Charge and an industry supervisor from the company.  There will be a mid-term company visit by the academic supervisor.  At the end of the internship, the student must give a presentation to the academic and industry supervisors, and submit a report summarizing what the student has done and learnt from the internship.  The student’s grade will be determined by (1) the presentation, (2) the student report and (3) a testimonial from the industry supervisor.The internship should normally take place in the summer term after a student has finished the first two semesters of studies.  Part-time students can decide to undertake the internship in the summer term of either the first or second year of studies.Students are recommended to seek the Professor-in-Charge's comment on potential internship opportunities before enrolling in the course.  Grade Descriptors:‘A’ and ‘A-’: EXCELLENT – exceptionally good performance and far exceeding expectation in all or most of the course learning outcomes; demonstration of superior understanding of the subject matter, the ability to analyze problems and apply extensive knowledge, and skillful use of concepts and materials to derive proper solutions.‘B+’, ‘B’, and ‘B-’: GOOD – good performance in all course learning outcomes and exceeding expectation in some of them; demonstration of good understanding of the subject matter and the ability to use proper concepts and materials to solve most of the problems encountered.‘C+’, ‘C’, and ‘C-’: FAIR – adequate performance and meeting expectation in all course learning outcomes; demonstration of adequate understanding of the subject matter and the ability to solve simple problems.‘D+’ and ‘D’: MARGINAL – performance barely meets the expectation in the essential course learning outcomes; demonstration of partial understanding of the subject matter and the ability to solve simple problems.‘F’: FAILURE – performance does not meet the expectation in the essential course learning outcomes; demonstration of serious deficiencies and the need to retake the course."

              "ENG": "The courses, Financial Technology Project I & II, involve a significant research and/or development project under the supervision of an academic staff in any area of financial technology.  Unless otherwise approved by the Professor-in-Charge, the project should involve an industrial partner with a co-supervisor from the industry.  At the end of the course, the student must give a presentation to the academic and industry supervisors, and submit a report detailing the findings and deliverables.  The student’s grade will be determined by the presentation and the report.Unless otherwise approved by the Programme Director, the credits for Financial Technology Project I are recognized if and only if the student takes also Financial Technology Project II in a subsequent semester.If a student has prior industrial background and has already secured a project topic with an industrial practitioner and the agreement of an academic staff, Financial Technology Project I can be taken in the first semester of studies.  Otherwise, the two project courses can be taken in any consecutive semesters, including the summer term.Students are encouraged to find industrial projects by themselves and talk to various academic staffs for project ideas before enrolling in the courses.  Grade Descriptors:‘A’ and ‘A-’: EXCELLENT – exceptionally good performance and far exceeding expectation in all or most of the course learning outcomes; demonstration of superior understanding of the subject matter, the ability to analyze problems and apply extensive knowledge, and skillful use of concepts and materials to derive proper solutions.‘B+’, ‘B’, and ‘B-’: GOOD – good performance in all course learning outcomes and exceeding expectation in some of them; demonstration of good understanding of the subject matter and the ability to use proper concepts and materials to solve most of the problems encountered.‘C+’, ‘C’, and ‘C-’: FAIR – adequate performance and meeting expectation in all course learning outcomes; demonstration of adequate understanding of the subject matter and the ability to solve simple problems.‘D+’ and ‘D’: MARGINAL – performance barely meets the expectation in the essential course learning outcomes; demonstration of partial understanding of the subject matter and the ability to solve simple problems.‘F’: FAILURE – performance does not meet the expectation in the essential course learning outcomes; demonstration of serious deficiencies and the need to retake the course."

              "ENG": "The United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2015-30 30 were adopted to strive for a world that is ‘just, equitable and inclusive’.  Those priority risk behaviours causing global burden of diseases are often established early in life and research findings have also confirmed the existence of common determinants (e.g., pathways in the brain) and the inter-relationships between the determinants of risk behaviours and behaviours themselves.  Improvement of behaviours and well-being of citizens would not naturally occur without a specific “intentional intervention”.  The concept of Healthy Setting is to cultivate a healthy physical/psycho-social environment in the setting where people spend most of the time for working, studying, enjoyment of life, or for specific purposes. It is a very effective “intentional intervention” in achieving improvements in both health and well-being of citizens as it would penetrate into the wide arrays of their daily experiences. The whole concept of healthy setting is also based on striving the principles of ‘just, equitable and inclusive’ for citizen development.  The key to successful implementation is engagement of key stakeholders in strategic way.Grade DescriptorsA                   Exceptional student A‐                 High performanceB+/ B/ B-      AVERAGE STUDENTC+/C/C-         Below average but demonstrating an acceptable grasp of main conceptsD+/D            Barely Passing          F                   UnacceptableP                    Pass"

              "ENG": "Hong Kong is at the crossroads of many legal traditions. The practice of law in Hong Kong is marked not only by the common law tradition but also by socialist law and the civil law tradition. There are even traces left of the pre-colonial indigenous Chinese legal practices in Hong Kong. Globalization has increased the volume of cross-border activities beyond Hong Kong and mainland China, requiring lawyers to become familiar with multi-jurisdictional issues. Consequently, comparative legal work is gaining in importance both globally and in Hong Kong. This course is designed to prepare students to practice law in an international setting and to give credit to the growing practical significance of comparative legal work. Students will examine the meaning and instrumental benefits of comparative law, explore how various legal systems and traditions are adapting to change, learn about academic debates within comparative law, and critically analyse traditional concepts of comparative law. They will also learn to appreciate the insights of approaching legal systems through a comparative perspective. This course has an emphasis on Asian legal systems and the law of the People’s Republic of China, in particular.For details of grade descriptors, please refer to http://www.law.cuhk.edu.hk/download/CUHK_Faculty_of_Law_Grade_Descriptors.pdf."

              "ENG": "Hong Kong is a small, but highly international, jurisdiction. Many legal disputes between private parties in Hong Kong involve legal rules, principles, and issues from other jurisdictions in China and abroad. These foreign laws are frequently inconsistent with the laws in Hong Kong. For instance, a contract concluded between a Hong Kong company and a US company in Japan may contain clauses that are enforceable in Japanese law but not in Hong Kong law. This course involves a study of the rules and principles for resolving conflicts that arise between Hong Kong law and the law of other jurisdictions. By incorporating a more extended range of mandatory readings than undergraduate courses of similar length and a more research-focused assessment regime, this course is designed specifically for students at the postgraduate level who have not previously studied the conflict of laws as it applies in a common law jurisdiction. The rules of Conflict of Laws (sometimes known as Private International Law) are orientated to answering three questions: (i) Which law applies in the event of a conflict? (ii) Do Hong Kong courts have jurisdiction to determine the dispute and should they exercise jurisdiction? (iii) Should a Hong Kong court recognise and enforce a foreign court’s judgment? These questions are examined in a few selected areas of law such as contracts, torts, family law, criminal law, and property.For details of grade descriptors, please refer to http://www.law.cuhk.edu.hk/download/CUHK_Faculty_of_Law_Grade_Descriptors.pdf."

              "ENG": "Mergers are the largest commercial transactions, and merger control is a fundamental part of competition law which regularly affects businesses in Hong Kong.  Mergers between companies are frequent in the business world, and more than 100 countries around the world have merger control laws that must be observed. Globalization inevitably implies that merger operations can bear effects on the conditions of competition in multiple jurisdictions, and therefore companies will have to ensure that their operations comply with the laws of every jurisdiction that comes into play. The large transactions are often subject to scrutiny by several regimes simultaneously. As a consequence, companies need to be aware of the implications of the principal merger control regimes to avoid delays and uncertainty. Firms in Hong Kong whose operations might affect other markets regularly seek legal advice on merger control rules in jurisdictions such as the US, the EU and Mainland China.This course aims to provide students with a solid theoretical and practical understanding of the principal merger control regimes that affect companies in Hong Kong. On December 14, 2015, Hong Kong’s very own merger regime entered into force. For the time being, it only affects the telecommunications sector. The course will analyse local merger control rules as well as the rules of those regimes which most frequently apply to merger transactions involving local firms. Both procedural and substantive aspects are covered, and the principal focus of the course will be on substance.For details of grade descriptors, please refer to http://www.law.cuhk.edu.hk/download/CUHK_Faculty_of_Law_Grade_Descriptors.pdf."

These businesses are ridiculed, especially in Hong Kong, as unprofessional and cronyism-driven. But one cannot ignore their importance: families started many of the most successful firms in the world; families owned the majority of listed firms; many family firms uphold the best innovation, quality and brand value; and family funds constitute some largest philanthropic and investment projects. This course takes a family enterprising approach to discuss the importance, diversity, complexity, and more importantly continuous entrepreneurship of business family (as opposed to family business). Apart from lectures and case analysis, students should interact with family members and associated professionals to understand the types, life cycle, conflict, succession, characteristics of business families. For sustaining their growth, practical approaches, such as structures and procedures as advisory boards, family councils, family venture funds and spin-offs, and family philanthropy, will also be discussed. This course shall benefit family business members, managers in family-owned firms, and professionals.Grade descriptors:A Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.A- Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.B Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes.F Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

              "ENG": "Making decisions, from the trivial to the fundamental, is part of the everyday life of every manager and investor. For the last 30 years, psychologists — and more recently also economists — have studied how people process information and make decisions. This research program has provided an insightful understanding of how people’s decisions deviate from “optimal” ones, and the consequences of such biases in financial and personal terms. This course is devoted to understanding the nature, causes and managerial implications of these limitations. It will help the students discover a series of serious yet often overlooked mistakes that most people would commit in a variety of decision contexts, including investment decisions, hiring decisions, purchase decisions and even marital decisions. At the same time, this course will also teach them how to correct these mistakes and how to reach optimal solutions. Instead of overwhelming the students with mathematic models or academic theories, this course will use many in-class exercises and questionnaires to convey the concepts.Blended-mode class section is available for this course.  Please refer to the “Class Notes” of the blended-mode class section for details.Grade descriptors:A Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.A- Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.B Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomesF Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

In this new decade, psychology has been re-defined as a science examining how human mind works in general.  Abnormal psychology, on the other hand, specializes in understanding how human mind works when it goes haywire. This course is designed to provide you with the most updated knowledge in the field of psychopathology.  You will learn about the key concepts of mental disorders, how mental  predispositions and upbringing experience interact in the development of various mental disorders, how human mind works in different mental disorders, and more importantly, how you can continue to learn about the science of psychopathology on your own after you have completed the course.
