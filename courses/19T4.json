It shows students how to apply such techniques in the context of finance. For example, discussion of a number of distributions pays special attention to heavy tail, skewness and other distribution features with regard to financial return analysis. Time-series analyses aim to explain the important influence of time-dependence in making economical predictions. Regression models cover CAPM as well as multifactor models to connote the cross-section relations among financial returns. GARCH and other volatility models introduce the related applications in risk management context. The course involves extensive use of real data examples and hands-on examples.Grade descriptors:A Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.A- Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.B Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes.F Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."

The course is divided into several main parts. The first part discusses technology at the macro level: its impact on industries and nations, and patterns of technological change. The second part focuses on disruptive innovations – what they are, how they affect firms and industry change, and how they facilitate entrepreneurship. The third part deals with the response of firms to disruptive innovations, including the changing basis of competition in markets. The increasing returns environment is also examined. The fourth part focuses on building the internal capabilities of organizations to innovate, and discusses the innovator's solution. The fifth part discusses additional topics in innovation such as entrepreneurship and spurring innovation at the societal level. Case studies, both written and video-based, are used extensively to illustrate a range of technologies and the problems associated with developing them and bringing them to market. The course spends much time examining new technologies, how to think strategically about them, how to develop them and how firms should pursue them (or why they fail to pursue these new technologies).Grade descriptors:A Outstanding performance on all learning outcomes.A- Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.B Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance.C Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.D Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes.F Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements."
